      <h1>About Crypto Dash</h1>
      <p>
        Crypto Dash is a lightweight React application that displays real-time
        cryptocurrency data using the CoinGecko API.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can explore leading cryptocurrencies by market capitalization,
        filter them by name or symbol, and sort the list by price, market cap,
        or 24-hour change.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project was created as part of a React tutorial designed to help
        you understand hooks, components, state management, and how to integrate
        external APIs.
      </p>
      <p>
        ðŸš€ Future updates may include detailed coin views, favorites,
        pagination, and additional features.
